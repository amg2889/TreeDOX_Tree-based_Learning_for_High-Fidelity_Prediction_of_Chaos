# TreeDOX_Tree-based_Learning_for_High-Fidelity_Prediction_of_Chaos

This repository contains most of the code used in support of the paper "Tree-based Learning for High Fidelity Prediction of Chaos" ($`\textcolor{red}{\text{INSERT DOI}}`$), with the exception of code ran on the [RIT Research Computing cluster](https://www.rit.edu/researchcomputing/) for ease of reproducibility. I will do my best to update this repository when I have time, but please [reach out if you have questions](mailto:amg2889@rit.edu).
